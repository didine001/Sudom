"""
Code made by GUENASSIA Amandine, SABOT DRESSY Nathan and MAHAMAT Mastoura.

We didn't add the colors to be more accurate and more executable and understandable from every operating system and python editor. We executed Black but it didn't format anything. All the code is fully functionnal, the word to find is shown at the beginning, you can unshow it by putting the line #134 on commentary by adding "#". All functions have an help definition and a linÃ©by line commentary. However a lot of things can be improve but it was the easiest way for us to do it.
